# Game of Life
This was an old student project I did in freshman year comp sci.

It was written in java, and is based off of java applets. 
All the software and tech used to make it is atleast a decade old (thanks public school), so it's pretty difficult to track down proper versions of apis and such to get it to run.
The easiest way to run it is to use Jcreator[http://www.jcreator.org/download.htm]
